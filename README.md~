# ROS_publisher

By Handuo

This is a program for capturing stereo Pointgrey images with Opencv capture and then convert cv::mat into ROS publisher.
Works under catkin (ROS workspace)!
So just put it under catkin workspace -> src folder and catkin_make it~~


# usage:

## Just show the captured stereo images
roslaunch flea3 capture.launch


## Record rosbag

roslaunch flea3 rosbag_capture.launch
